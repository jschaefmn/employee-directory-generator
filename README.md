# Employee Directory Generator

## Descriptions and features
This application allows the user to follow the command-line prompts to add:
- A manager name, id, email, and room number
- A Engineer employee name, id, email, and GitHub username that links to their GitHub account and opens in a new tab when clicked
- A Intern employee name, id, email, and what school they currently are attending

Once all the prompts are complete and the user doesn't want to add anymore employees, and HTML document is automatically generated with all the information provided by the user that they open in a web browser
